We are drowning in information but starving for wisdom. It's time to **curate** our digital inputs.

### The Problem of "Always On"

In the age of ubiquitous notifications, our attention is fragmenting. Cal Newport defines Digital Minimalism as:

> "A philosophy of technology use in which you focus your online time on a small number of carefully selected and optimized activities that strongly support things you value, and then happily miss out on everything else."

### Practical Steps

1.  **Delete Social Media from Phone**: Make it a "desktop only" activity.
2.  **Batch Notifications**: Check emails/messages only 3 times a day.
3.  **Embrace Solitude**: Leave your phone behind when going for a walk.

### The Result

By reducing the noise, we make space for deep work and meaningful connection. It's not about being a luddite; it's about being intentional.
